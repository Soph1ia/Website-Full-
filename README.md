# Website-Full-
This is a dog club website that implements an (almost) full stack. It allows for a user to register and account 
and sign in. Upon signing in, user is redirected to a page that contains a message feed (that can only be accessed if successful login)
This message feed is (twitter styled) where user can leave a comment and that comment is saved to the database. 
Every few seconds the page is updated to check if there are any new comments made in the database.

# Stack
- HTML & CSS
- Bootstrap 
- JavaScript
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
